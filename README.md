Hey, I see that you've stumbled across this colour palette.  

I just want it to be known that this is more of a "let's figure out palettes and NPM" project, and less of a "catppuccin with different colours."

Once this palette is in a reasonable spot, I will begin releasing ports for all of the stuff I use it on. AND provide documentation.  

Thank you for your patience!
